Iâ€™ve been on the Mantra M5 for the past several years and absolutely love them. I wondered if the Kastles would feel or perform hugely different or underwhelming. Iâ€™m happy to report the answer is â€œnoâ€ on both counts. \n\nThe Kastles are responsive, quick (for a ski in this category, relatively damp (for a ski with no metal), hold an edge very well, and are amenable to different turn shapes. Very fun and lively in the right conditions. \n\nIn soft, chopped up powder, the Kastles were great. Theyâ€™re a bit lighter than the Mantras with substantially softer tips. The Mantra is an incredibly versatile ski, but it wants to charge in all conditions. The Kastles provided better float, were easier to throw around, and provided a little more energy coming out of a turn. With the softer tips and lack of metal, it felt easier to load up the ski and pop out of a turn. \n\nIn very firm chop or windblown powder . . . the Kastles performed fine but I really felt the tails if I got in the backseat. Theyâ€™re not crud busters, but they donâ€™t hide from the crud, either. Interestingly, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever noticed the tails on the Mantra, which has a reputation as a moderately beefy, stiff ski. \n\nFirst day on the Kastles in soft chop, I give them 9/10. Really fun, quick ski. No problem getting the tails to release and didn&#x27;t have to drive them hard. Might even prefer them to the Mantra in those conditions. \n\nSecond day in firm chop, I give them 6.5/10. On back to back runs, I skied the Kastles and then Head Kore 105s (184cm). Same terrain, same lines in ~8â€ of quite firm chop. The Heads were superior in almost every dimension. The Heads have more rocker and a lot of early taper in the tips and tails; despite being almost 10mm wider under foot, they were substantially easier to initiate turns in. Possibly the wider platform provided enough additional float to really keep me on top of the snow, but I felt like the Heads were also easier to turn on slopes with just a few inches of chalk. \n\nOn piste, the Kastles were also a lot of fun. Again - lively, energetic, easy to turn, solid edge hold.","These skis are so amazing, I got them 4 days before a week of skiing in Colorado. These skis were shorter than a few of my friends skis, but they were much faster! Haha!. I got plenty of groomed runs and these skis did everything I wanted them to do, they are stiff and very reactive.

Running the Fischer Attack 14 bindings. I am an Advanced level skier skiing primarily in PA so lots of hard snow conditions and variability. Have owned a lot of skis - Head Monster 83, Volkl Kendo, Head iTitan, and Atomic Vantage 79 Ti to name a few. Have demoed lots of other skis. These are the most intuitive and fastest skis I have ever been on. Great edge grip. They will slarve, pivot, slide or do any type of movement I ask. Best skis I have been on in tight spaces where I need to do slashing short turns. Stable at speed. I feel like I am on autopilot at times on these - stand in the right place on these and let them take you down the mountain. Not tiring to ski despite a bit of heft to them. Roll your ankles and they turn. Handle wet mounded up snow very well - go around the piles or through them, it doesnâ€™t really matter. Build quality is terrific. The Attack bindings are rock solid and donâ€™t require a lot of force to get out of unlike the Marker Griffon bindings I normally run. I did have to adjust a bit because I found myself over skiing them especially noticeable as I was pushing the tips around too much during turns. I was used to feeling like I had to pressure the whole turn on my previous skis - with these once the turn initiates I can just relax and ride the arc until the next turn transition. I also had to reduce the quickness of my turn initiation and not be so dynamic - again these skis donâ€™t require a lot to initiate the turn so I had to tone it down a bit and let them do the work. Having said that - I would not recommend these for anyone but a solid intermediate with good technique or up.",,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,Fischer Ranger 90 Skis,Sidecut at 177cm: 124-90-114  Turn Radius at 177cm: 17m  Weight at 177cm: 1850g per ski  The Flex-Cut at the binding area optimized,FSHR201

Starting with Elan's critically acclaimed TubeLite Woodcore that features two carbon rods following the sidecut of the ski, Elan then positioned two additional carbon rods in the center of the ski, in the tip and tail for optimal balance and power distribution. Next, Elan enhanced the Amphibio Profile by adding Carbon Line, a carbon weave placed along the inside edge for a smooth feel with great edge grip, in the tip and tail. The tech is anchored with an additional wall-to-wall layer of exclusive carbon under the binding for lightning-quick power transmission and stability, without interrupting the natural flex pattern, for unrivaled performance that is intuitively harnessed by the skier. Lastly, Elan cloaked this masterpiece in a stealth, black, camo wrap.

Amphibio skis feature a cambered inside edge assuring precision, edge grip, and stability while a rockered outside edge provides forgiveness, turning ease and smooth transitions.</li><li>Tubelite Wood Core: To create the TubeLite Wood Core, two super lightweight Carbon tubes are inserted into a lightweight laminated wood core. Measuring 5mm in diameter and hollow in their construction, these tubes run along the length of the ski following the arc of the side cut. They provide torsional stability and powerful rebound while allowing for material reduction of the core. The result is incredible lightweight response and stability.</li><li>Carbon Line Technology: Amphibio Carbon Line technology is a combination of innovations that provide the best balance of lightweight construction with power and performance. Amphibio Carbon Line technology elevates the asymmetrical ski design to the next level by strategically locating carbon reinforcement over the inside edges of the skis providing more power in the turn, while carbon rods inserted into the woodcore maximize weight savings and overall stability.

They arrived in good shape just four days after I ordered them. On careful inspection I found no defects, the top sheet, bases and edges pristine, and no warp when laid flat on my granite countertop. I had them mounted with Look SPX 12 GW bindings, and took them up to Timberline Lodge on a day of no new snow, icy groomers at the start of the day, softening up to corn snow as the temperature rose. A few small moguls developed by the end of the day. I skied in all of these conditions, and found the skis to be more than up to the task at every step. Smooth, great carving skis, easy turn initiation, good hold on ice, able to feather the edge and drift when needed, very skiable at slow speeds in crowds, then no real speed limit that I found when I could open things up. Stable, damp, not a lot of pop in the turns but still light and quick. I have my Dynastar M Free 99 for deep snow days, and my Rossi EXP 84 for early/late season, but these MX 83â€™s will be my new daily driver.","I have not mounted bindings on the MX83s yet. I am currently skiing on Kastle MX84s and have about 60 days on them. By far, the best fronside ski I have ever owned and I have been skiing 51 years.

I didn&#x27;t see a ton of difference between these and the rentals I usually get with the exception of two things: (1) when I accidentally cross my tips I don&#x27;t have the rental ski grips that keep me from quickly correcting, and (2) I seem to slide along much easier so those catwalks aren&#x27;t as difficult. \n\nI did get the Tyrola Defiance 12 GripWalk bindings and they don&#x27;t clear the skis very well. Essentially, when you connect the two skis together to cary them, the bindings aren&#x27;t wide enough to allow the sister ski to sit into the pocket. I&#x27;m going to try and adjust them and see if that work. If I had to do it all over again, I would have opted for the Markers.

Transitioning from rentals since 2021, I committed to mastering this winter sport and decided to invest in my own equipment. Over the past weekend, I ventured to Timberland, West Virginia, and had the opportunity to test my skis for the first time.\n\nInitially, the skis felt a bit unwieldy due to their length (165cm), but I quickly adapted and found my comfort on the slopes. Progressing from the green slopes, I steadily increased my speed, placing trust in my skis. Eventually, I mustered the courage to tackle my first blue slope without any falls â€“ a significant achievement for me.

Backed by Defiance's Lifetime warranty you can rest assured this pair of skis is built to last.

They might ski fast sometimes, and have a blast, but aren't comfortable with some areas of the mountain.</li><li>Composite Core: This ski features a composite core, which has a softer flex and is lighter weight than wood cores. Junior, entry-level, and sometimes even women's models have this type of core to make skiing more enjoyable, and less work.</li><li>Cap Construction: The top sheet of this ski drapes over the edge to form a clean and rounded finish to the side of the ski. This style of construction adds some torsional rigidity and helps reduce top sheet chipping when the skis hit each other.</li><li>Fiber Tech Wrap: A fiberglass network that surrounds the core of the ski. This technology helps the ski flex evenly, creating a smooth, effortless turn.</li><li>Extruded Base: This durable material requires little maintenance and holds wax for a long period of time, so you don't have to wax as often.</li></ul>",10343,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,130cm,140cm,,,,,,279.99,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Defiance Flash Pink 130-140cm Complete Ski Package with,"Camber/Rocker: Defiance's Camber/Rocker profile is 80% traditional camber, and 20% early rise, which means that these skis are going to hold an edge,",CSP22010

A wide variety of turn shapes and an intuitive feel.</p><p><b>SWALLOWTAIL:</b> A dramatic tail knockout de-couples the farthest reaches of the effective edge while simultaneously forcing the tail of the ski down in soft snow. The result is a ski that can be ridden at shorter lengths without sacrificing performance. An eye-catcher for sure in the liftline but it's not just eye-candy, Eric Pollard pushed for this design after experiencing its advantages in surfing and snowboard designs. The swallowtail design is as important as what it is as what it's not! The absence of material in the tail drastically reduces weight while the shape maintains a long effective edge for arching turns and staying in control. In powder, the tail drops you back in the snow lifting your tips for ample flotation while maintaining a neutral skiing stance so you're not in the backseat trying to stay afloat. For those concerned about durability have no fear, the tail is reinforced with titanal so stay in once piece.</p><p><b>CARBON FLAX TAPE:</b> Carbon Stringers offset by Flax Taping create added stiffness without the pingy, deflective properties of Carbon.</p><p><b>SIDEWALL CONSTRUCTION:</b> Ultra-High Density Polyethylene vertical walls over the edges absorb vibrations and provide powerful energy transmission.</p><p><b>EARLY RISE:</b> The tip and tail lift away from the snow to bring the contact points closer to the center of the ski. This increases a ski's lift in deep snow and allows it to engage more quickly on hardpack when rolled over on edge.</p><p><b>DIRECTIONAL FLEX:</b> The softer tip floats & initiates turns easily while the stiffer tail provides power, stability & high speed control.</p>",39886,166cm,174cm,181cm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,799.95,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Line Sakana Alpine Skis 2025,Shape:  150-105-138   Weight (g/ski):  1770   Sidecut Radius Avg (m):  15   Stance Back from Center (mm):,PNTL03600

Simple as that. Thanks to a swallowtail design, soft flex, and a massive shovel, the LINE Pescado floats through deep snow like a dream. A directional back-mounted stance allows the ski's tail to sink in deeper snow, thus raising the tip and giving you more control through the deepest of the deep, while the same concept allows the Pescado to carve groomers exceptionally well.

The result is a ski that can be ridden at shorter lengths without sacrificing performance. An eye-catcher for sure in the liftline but it's not just eye-candy, Eric Pollard pushed for this design after experiencing its advantages in surfing and snowboard designs. The swallowtail design is as important as what it is as what it's not! The absence of material in the tail drastically reduces weight while the shape maintains a long effective edge for arching turns and staying in control. In powder, the tail drops you back in the snow lifting your tips for ample flotation while maintaining a neutral skiing stance so you're not in the backseat trying to stay afloat. For those concerned about durability have no fear, the tail is reinforced with titanal so stay in once piece.</p><p><b>SIDEWALL CONSTRUCTION:</b> Ultra-High Density Polyethylene vertical walls over the edges absorb vibrations and provide powerful energy transmission.</p><p><b>EARLY RISE:</b> The tip and tail lift away from the snow to bring the contact points closer to the center of the ski.

If you&#x27;re considering buying this ski, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ve watched the video review by those two essential guys who usually provide good information. However, their video covering the Unleashed 90 contained some misinformation in that they stated that this is an all wood narrower version of the Nordica Unleashed. This is false. This ski uses the same construction as the rest of the Unleashed line up, including the Ti layer. I confirmed this with Nordica customer service. The Soul Rider 90 is a construction layer twin of the other Unleashed skis with a different name. The Unleashed 90 has the Ti layer in its construction and so does the Soul Rider 90.\n\nWith that out of the way, how does it perform? I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of skiing these for a few days in Stowe now under varying conditions. First on hard pack/ice with bare spots. The weather in the NE has been more than disappointing. They performed as well as I could have hoped under those conditions. Slight chatter at times, but there isn&#x27;t a ski made that won&#x27;t on the skating rink we had in Vermont for weeks on end. I ran these next to my custom built front side skis. I&#x27;m not going to try to tell you they out performed them, but they certainly held their own in some of the worst trail conditions I&#x27;ve seen in years, and at less than half the price of the others ones. There is noticeable improvement on a groomed trail with some fresh snow. Obviously. They really held their own and were a joy to ski on. Finally, I got to try them out on a fresh dump of snow, or at least the biggest we&#x27;ve had so far this year. This is where I started to see the difference in comparison to my narrower and more side cut skis. The Soul Rider is perfect for New England snow days. They feel right at home. This is why I chose this ski and was not disappointed. They will be great for 90% of the days in Vermont. Good on the ice days at the beginning and end of the season, better on the groomers, and even better on a good snow day. That makes them a great ski to reach for most of the time. If you&#x27;re looking for a deep powder ski, you already know enough to look elsewhere. That isn&#x27;t what these are for. \n\n The positives are that they are very stable while still being forgiving and with enough of a playful feel to use on the side bumps and park. Balance and versatility are the keys here. If you&#x27;re looking for something to use for most of the east coast conditions you encounter, they&#x27;re a great choice. The only negative I&#x27;ve seen if that they max out at 174 for length. If you&#x27;re looking for a longer ski, you may be out of luck. However, I will say that as a bigger guy on the 174&#x27;s (6 ft. 220), I never felt the need for more ski in the days that I&#x27;ve used them. The rocker profile allows for a long effective base length. \n\nOverall, I&#x27;m extremely happy with the Soul Rider 90. They&#x27;ll be my ski of choice on most days in New England for the foreseeable future.","I bought these for my wife as a Christmas present !

The Revolt 90 is three millimetres wider and definitely more versatile than its predecessor - partly on account of its new construction and modified sidecut. The Revolt is built around a Light Swingweight wood core. In this design, weight is reduced at the ski ends and concentrated in the middle, making the ski much easier to turn in the air with more control. The sidewall of the ski is given an extra layer for use in the park, which improves stability and makes the ski more durable. The Revolt is generally super smooth to ride. Thanks to its tip and tail rocker, nose butters and tail presses are virtually effortless. The new, totally unique design of this year's edition of Built Together is by Chinese artist King Rhomberg.

The low weight of the softwood part in the middle of the ski brings more agility and maneuverability and reduces overall ski weight. The combination of both wood types running through the entire ski length contributes to an optimal distribution of the ski stiffness increasing the steering precision.
